# Phyton - A StarCraft II bot api client library for Python 3

Phyton is an easy-to-use library for wrting AI Bots for StarCraft II in Python 3. The ultimate goal is simplicity and ease of use, while still preserving all funcionality. A simple worker rush bot should be not more than twenty lines of code, not two hundred.

This library covers only the scripted (=raw) interface.
